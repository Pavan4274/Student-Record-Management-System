# Student Record Management System

A simple **Java console-based application** that allows you to manage student records using basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- View all student records  
- Update existing student details  
- Delete a student by ID

## 🧠 How It Works
1. When you run the program, a **menu** appears with options.
